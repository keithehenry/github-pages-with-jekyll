I'm taking a [HTML CSS JavaScript course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/welcome) at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

We detoured into using GitHub. The class uses GitHub Pages to post assignments. I did a few of their tutorials. Who knew you could create and host entire websites using Jekyll right at GitHub? *(Everyone but me I think.)* Very powerful.

[KeithEHenry.com](http://www.keithehenry.com) was in a dire need of a facelift so now it's hosted at GitHub using the [Basically-Basic](https://mmistakes.github.io/jekyll-theme-basically-basic/) theme. Pretty nifty, eh?
