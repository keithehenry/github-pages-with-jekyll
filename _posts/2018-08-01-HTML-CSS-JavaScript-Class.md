I'm taking [this] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/welcome) HTML CSS JavaScript course at Coursera.org.

In the process we detoured into using GitHub. I did a few tutorials there. One thing led to another and now I'm hosting www.keithehenry.com there using GitHub pages and Jekyll.
