Resume from LinkedIn data.

This theme has a CV layout, automatic Curriculum-Vitæ generator, from JSON data. I wanted to play with it, so... I updated then exported my LinkedIn data [here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/member-data). Found and used this [LinkedIn to Json Résumé](https://jmperezperez.com/linkedin-to-json-resume) converter. Cut and pasted into this very handy [resume creator](http://registry.jsonresume.org). Uploaded the JSON to GitHub. Created resume.md with the required Jekyll "Front Matter". Reviewed and repeated only a half a dozen times and voilá... a beautiful [Resume](/resume.html) page!

It shows up on the main menu. Maybe I'll try to hide it later.

*It's not the destination but the journey that matters.* :wink:
