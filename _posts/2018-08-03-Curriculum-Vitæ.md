[Exported LinkedIn data](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/member-data). Used [LinkedIn to Json Résumé](https://jmperezperez.com/linkedin-to-json-resume) converter. Cut and pasted into a very handy [resumé creator](http://registry.jsonresume.org). Uploaded JSON to GitHub. Created cv.md with the required Jekyll "Front Matter". Reviewed and repeated only a half a dozen times and voilá... a beautiful [Curriculum-Vitæ](/cv.html) page!

*It's the journey you know.* :wink:
