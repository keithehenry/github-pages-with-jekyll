Testing the theme's CV layout.

This them has a Curriculum-Vitæ from JSON data generator I thought I'd play with, so...
I updated then exported my LinkedIn data [here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/member-data). Found and used this [LinkedIn to Json Résumé](https://jmperezperez.com/linkedin-to-json-resume) converter. Cut and pasted into this very handy [resume creator](http://registry.jsonresume.org). Uploaded the JSON to GitHub. Created resume.md with the required Jekyll "Front Matter". Reviewed and repeated only a half a dozen times and voilá... a beautiful [Resume](/resume.html) page!

*It's not the destination but the journey that matters.* :wink:
