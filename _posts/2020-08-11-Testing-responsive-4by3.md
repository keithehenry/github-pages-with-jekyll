A Google Slides presentation experiment.

Adding:

    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">

fixed the appearence of the last post on a smartphone in portrait. How's "4by3" look?

And the answer is: *"Slightly better, because the original photos are 4:3."*
Tilting the phone to landscape still works, resulting in clipping, or if that's annoying,
go into "Full Screen" mode for the letterbox look.
