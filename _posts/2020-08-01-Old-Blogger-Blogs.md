Revamping old blogs with Jekyll and free hosting at Github.

Using Blogger export, Google takeout, Jekyll import, Pandoc, and numerous ad-hoc shell scripts,
I managed to revamp two old sad blogs, originally hosted at Blogger, and recreate them here.

What's really surprising is that they can be hosted here at Github, for free, at a domain (and sub-domains)
not associated with this one. Free hosting just gets better and better.
