My old X10 [CM11A](http://kbase.x10.com/wiki/CM11A) is back up and working! This is the story:
I had an old male-RS232 to something adapter with the other end cut off. I striped the outer insulator off and discovered an outer shield, presumably ground, and one black and one brown wire.

It is an USB to RS232 interface using a MSP430G2553 Launchpad development board and a level converter module. I'm using it to interface to and program an old [CM11A](http://kbase.x10.com/wiki/CM11A) (X10 interface.)
